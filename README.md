# React Table-App with Vite

## Overview

This is a classical React web application built using Vite as the build tool. The project is written in TypeScript and utilizes various technologies such as MockAPI.io for mocking API responses, Axios for making HTTP requests, and, of course, React for building the user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: Vite is a fast and opinionated build tool that aims to provide a lightning-fast development experience for web projects.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- **MockAPI.io**: MockAPI.io is used for creating mock APIs, allowing developers to simulate backend responses during development and testing.
- **Axios**: Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. It is used in this project for handling API requests and responses.
- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a declarative and efficient way to create interactive UI components.
